# 🧠 AlgoHunt

**A multi-platform problem-solving archive documenting my journey through algorithms, patterns, and resilience.**

---

## 📍 What is AlgoHunt?

This is my personal space to track solutions and reflections from coding platforms like:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- (More to be added as the hunt expands)

Each solution contains:

- Clean `.cpp`, `.py`, `.java` implementations
- A one-liner problem summary
- My approach and reflections as comments or notes

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

- To build **pattern recognition**, not just pass test cases  
- To reflect on **what stumped me and how I broke through**  
- To craft a **version-controlled learning timeline**

I’m not aiming to solve everything. I’m hunting what teaches me something.

## 🔧 Tech & Workflow

- 🌱 Languages: C++ (initially), Python & Java coming soon  
- 💻 Editor: VS Code  
- 📖 `.gitignore` set up for C++, Python, and Java environments  
- 🔄 Commit history reflects growth, not just quantity

---

## 💬 Reflections > Solutions

Some problems I’ll solve and forget. Others? I’ll write about.  
Check the top comments or accompanying `notes.md` files for:

- Missteps I made
- Tricks I discovered
- Edge cases that surprised me

---

## 🚧 In Progress

- Platform-wise tagging and tracking  
- Curated notes per topic cluster  
- Expanding into multi-language versions of solved problems
